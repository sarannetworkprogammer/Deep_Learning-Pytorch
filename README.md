#Machinelearning by Dr.Rad  

## This repository contains Google Colab notebooks that demonstrate how to implement various machine learning models and techniques using PyTorch. 

### The models covered in this repository include:  

##### Linear Regression  
#####  Regression  
##### Neural Networks  
##### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)  
##### Support Vector Machines (SVMs)  
##### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNNs)  

In addition to implementing these models, covered some other topics  

##### Dataset and DataLoader  
##### Dataset Transforms  
##### Softmax and Cross Entropy  
##### Activation Functions  
##### MNIST Dataset  
##### CIFAR10 Dataset with 2 hidden layers and k-fold cross-validation
